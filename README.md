# FedFod Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the FedFod frontend application repository!

The FedFod application is a web application designed to mimic the functionality of the popular social media platform TikTok, but with a focus on food-related content. Its main objective is to provide users with a platform to discover, watch, and share short video clips related to cooking, recipes, food reviews, and culinary experiences. However, it's important to note that while the application replicates certain features of TikTok, its primary purpose is for learning and practice rather than creating an exact copy.
